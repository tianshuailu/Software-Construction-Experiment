# Software Construction Lab1
This is the experiment I did in Software Construction course.
This lab trains basic Java programming skills by solving four questions (one of which is optional), enabling students to develop basic functional modules using Java OO, read and understand existing code frameworks, and complete code based on functional requirements. Develop the ability to write basic test cases and complete tests for the code being developed, initially ensuring the correctness of the code being developed. On the other hand, the lab uses Git as a tool for code configuration management to learn the basics of using Git.
Main points:
- Basic Java OO programming
- Java programming based on the Eclipse IDE
- JUnit-based testing
- Git-based code configuration management
